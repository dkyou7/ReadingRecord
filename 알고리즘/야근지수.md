```python
import heapq


def solution(n, works):
    answer = 0
    arr = []
    for work in works:
        heapq.heappush(arr,(-work,work))
    while n != 0:
        tmp = heapq.heappop(arr)[1]
        if tmp-1 <= 0:
            heapq.heappush(arr,(0,0))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(arr,(-(tmp-1),tmp-1))
        n -= 1
    for el in arr:
        answer += el[1]**2
    return answer
```
